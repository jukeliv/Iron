# Iron
Iron is a 2D Open Source lightweight "Game Engine" made with SDL 2

	Hey, i wanted to say, that when you download this from github, what you see is an example scene i made for the engine, 
	if you dont want to use that base, delete everything inside "src" except "Iron_Engine", but the way i set everything up 
	in the example is the way i want you to use Iron, so try that :)

## HOW TO COMPILE
### Hey, this only works with Visual Studio ( only tested on vs 2019 )
### if you are doing this, is cuz you want to distribute your project, so remember, use "Distro" to compile
- Hit F5 for start building the project
- It it's going to compile inside "bin\Distro-x64\$(ProjectName)\"
- in that path you paste all the dll files inside "Iron"
- and you paste the resource "res" folder inside the same path

AND YOU ARE READY TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR SOFTWARE :)
