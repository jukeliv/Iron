# Iron
Iron is a 2D lightweight "Game Engine" made with SDL 2

## HOW TO COMPILE
### Hey dude, this only works with Visual Studio ( only tested on vs 2019 )
  - Hit the "Build" button inside Visual Studio
  - When the project its compiled, copy all the dll's inside "Iron_DLL" inside "Bin\Release-x64\(UR_PROJECT_NAME)\"
  - And paste "res" folder inside the same path

AND YOU ARE READY TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR SOFTWARE :)
